# Strange Light Show

A Halloween project that I put together for a Haunted House.
Originally written in some time in 2016, I just now uploaded as part of cleaning house, and old code revision.

### Purpose

This sketch is built for a microcontroller to run a series of addressable LEDs. LEDs are meant to be hung above a series of painted letters. The final effect is to emulate a famous scene in the first season of 'Stranger Things'. But with custom messages. 

Medium-Tech Ouija Board.

### Actual Implementation

String of lights were posted on a building adjacent to the Haunted House queue. As a small nod to pop culture and a minor novelty to entertain patrons while waiting. It seemed well received among the portfolio of queue line entertainment items.
